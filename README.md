# OPT-Tools
These set of tools allows building and hosting of several OPT mods.

## Components

### /settings/

| File | Info |
|------|------|
| setMetaData.bat | Copy/Rename the provided example and adjust your local filepaths and preferences. |
| serverConfig.cfg | Serverconfig for the local ArmA-DevServer. Do not edit the mission-name, because it's changed automatically. |

### /tools/
These scripts can directly be executed by the user or his IDE. Each filename describes the task.
To automatically close the scripts after execution, execute them with a "noPause" parameter or adjust the `WaitAtFinish` setting in `setMetaData.bat`.

| Script | Info |
|--------|------|
| buildAll.bat | Rebuild all mission/mods. If ArmA Client/Server are running, they will be shut down first and restarted afterwards. |
| buildMission.bat | Packs mission from OPT-Mission to PBO-Folder. Mission name is set via `setMetaData.bat`. First start requires administrator rights to create a symlink for EDEN-Editor. |
